# Minimum-Enclosing-Circle-B-Spline
### Minimum Enclosing Circle (1st School Project)


What is requested from us in this project; When n points are given by the user on a 2 dimensional plane with integer coordinates, it is to draw the circle with the smallest radius containing these points, to draw the curve passing through the nearest n points and to calculate the radius and center of the circle we have drawn. Calculation and drawing are made using the text file available in the project.

The project is written in C language.
Any IDE and C++ compiler are required to run the project. (MinGW)
The points required for the project are printed from the CoordinatePoint.txt file in the project folder. It can be changed when desired.
